-- | More powerful than 'isOurs', this abstractions offer the underlying state
-- the ability to find / compute the address private key corresponding to a
-- given known address.
--
-- Requiring 'IsOwned' as a constraint supposed that there is a way to recover
-- the root private key of a particular wallet. This isn't true for externally
-- owned wallet which would delegate its key management to a third party (like
-- a hardware Ledger or Trezor).
--
-- Derive the private key corresponding to an address. Careful, this
-- operation can be costly. Note that the state is discarded from this
-- function as we do not intend to discover any addresses from this
-- operation; This is merely a lookup from known addresses.
